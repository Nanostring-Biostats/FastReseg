2.	LICENSE
2.1.	Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, revocable license to: (a) use, Distribute, and reproduce the Program, and (b) use, create, Distribute, and reproduce Modified Programs, in each case, solely for your internal, Non-Commercial Use. No rights are granted to NanoString Competitors.
2.2.	No Endorsement. Nothing in this License may be construed as permission to assert or imply that Licensor, NanoString, or other contributors to the Program sponsors, endorses, or is otherwise connected with the Licensee or the entity or institution that Licensee represents.
2.3.	Trademarks. Trademark rights are not licensed to you under this License.
2.4.	Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, NanoString hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, import, and otherwise transfer the Program, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by NanoString that are necessarily infringed by Licensee alone or by combination of its modification(s) to the Program or Modified Program to which such modification(s) was submitted. If you institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program, Modified Program, or a modification incorporated within the Program or a Modified Program constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to you under this License for the Program or any such Modified Program shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

3.	CONDITIONS TO THE RIGHT TO DISTRIBUTE
3.1.	Notices. If you Distribute the Program or a Modified Program in any form, you must also provide to the recipient:
3.1.1.	a copy of this License; and
3.1.2.	for Modified Programs, prominent notices identifying the portions of the Modified Program that have been modified, stating that you have modified the Program.
3.2.	Attribution.

In addition, you must also include a prominent hypertext link back to NanoString’s website at www.nanostring.com.
3.3.	License. You may only Distribute the Program or the Modified Program under the terms of this License (or any later version, at your election).

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW FOR THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE FOREGOING MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

5.	MISCELLANEOUS
5.1.	Right to Enforce. NanoString is an express third-party beneficiary of this License and will be entitled to enforce the provisions of this License as if it were a party hereto.
5.2.	Waiver; Amendment.

The waiver by Licensor of, or consent by Licensor to, a breach of any provision of this License by the Licensee, will not constitute, operate or be construed as a waiver of, consent to, or excuse of any other or subsequent breach by Licensee.  This License may be amended or modified only by an agreement in writing signed by an authorized representative of each of Licensor and Licensee.
